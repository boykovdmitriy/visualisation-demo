# visualisation-demo

In this repo you can see my d3.js demos

1. Area chart with gradient filling. 
2. Bar chart with custom design of charts.
3. Horizontal chart.

You can find here how to update your charts when data or screen size changed 
based on parent container size.

Feel free to contact me for collaboration :)
